ZedSDR
======

This repository contains a hardware design for a software defined radio based
on the Ettus Research E100 USRP. It consists of a clock generator and an AD9862
ADC/DAC frontend. It is designed to be connected to the LPC connector on a
Digilent Zedboard.

The hardware design is a work in progress. Any help or comments are appreciated.
